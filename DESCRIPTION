Description: A suite of utilities for working with the NMR metabolomics data in
    UK Biobank. Includes functions for extracting biomarkers from raw UK Biobank 
    field data, removing unwanted technical variation from biomarker concentrations,
    computing an extended set of lipid, fatty acid, and cholesterol fractions, and 
    for re-deriving composite biomarkers and ratios after adjusting data for 
    unwanted biological variation.
