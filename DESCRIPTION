Description: A suite of utilities for working with the NMR metabolomics data in
    UK Biobank. Includes functions for extracting biomarkers from raw UK Biobank 
    field data, computing an extended set of lipid, fatty acid, and cholesterol 
    fractions, and for re-deriving composite biomarkers and ratios after 
    adjusting data for unwanted biological variation.
